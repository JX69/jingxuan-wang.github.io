# Hi, I'm Jingxuan.

<img title="" src="me.png" alt="" width="242" data-align="inline">

I'm an applicant for the MFE program at Berkeley Haas. My areas of interest include Deep Neural Networks, NLP-based trading strategies, pension fund management, and biotechnology.

Prior to attending Berkeley, I completed my undergraduate studies at Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management (THU SEM). For more information, please see my [CV](CV/CV_Jingxuan_Wang.pdf).

In my spare time, I am dedicated to volunteering activities and enjoy long-distance cycling. I also have a passion for spicy food.
